# AD300-TemplateRepository

You can compile and then run the code with 
```
./run.sh
```

(you might have to give it permission to execute and I've only tested it on mac, fedora and nixos)

You will have to download JUnit 5 to run the tests, I used the "JUnit JAR Downloader" extension on VSCode to get the JAR and the included "Test Runner for Java" extension to run the tests.
