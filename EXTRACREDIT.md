For this project I implemented many test cases using JUnit and the ParameterizedTest option to make the class more readable. This allowed me to test many different edge cases and ensure that my util class wouldn't throw errors and would handle many diferent edge cases properly. This makes the util class easier to test in the future and if extra features are added there is a testing framework to make sure that they work as expected. (I'm not sure how much extra credit this qualifies for but I figured I would write something anyway)
